-I didn't do any of those rigorous things that good software engineers do like actually reproduce the problem myself, code a fix, then show it's not reproducing anymore.

-Evolution is a myth. Why aren't monkeys still evolving into humans?
-American scientific companies are cross-breeding humans and animals, and coming up with mice with fully functioning human brains!
-I was an English major, so break it down: -ist means one who celebrates. As a feminist, I celebrate my femininity.

-Sarah Stoesz, who heads the Planned Parenthood operation in my state of Minnesota, said she recently opened three express centers in wealthy Minnesota suburbs, and shopping centers and malls and places where women are already doing their grocery shopping, picking up Starbucks, living their daily lives, and stopping off for an abortion.

-Carbon dioxide is portrayed as harmful, but there isn't even one study that can be produced that shows carbon dioxide is a harmful gas.
-Normalization through desensitization. Very effective way to do this with a bunch of second graders is to take a picture of the Lion King, for instance, and the teacher might say "Do you know the music for this movie was written by a gay man?" The message is: I'm better at what I do because I'm gay.

-[Referring to former prisoner of war and torture victim, Senator John McCain] he doesn’t understand how enhanced interrogation works. I mean, you break somebody, and after they’re broken, they become cooperative.
-In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality.
